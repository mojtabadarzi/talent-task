## some issues
- We must ensure a maximum width for the list to truncate item text and prevent overflow.
- The dropdown section is too close to the upper button and is positioned to the right of the button. Sometimes, we need to reposition this section around the button, but I think in this specific case, we don't need to (we need to discuss this).
- I had some issues with sizes, but I tried to implement sizes that closely match the design.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
